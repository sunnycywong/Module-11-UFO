# Module-11-UFO

## (1) Overview 
The objective is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. 

## (2) Results                                                                           
On the left hand side of the webpage, there are five filters (date, city, state, country, and shape) that users could use to sort out the UFO records.

Below are two sample results that were pulled by using the date filter and state filter.

## (3) Summary    
A drawback of this website is the auto-population. It would be more user-friendly, if the result was being generated after the user has selected all the relevant filters, then populate the result. 

As an improvement, it would be helpful to add a "submit" button to click on before population the result. 

Moreover, from an analysis perspective, it would also be helpful to create a filter to sort by duration. And a more advanced setting would be filtered by keywords from the comments column. By adding these two columns, the users would be able to get a more in depth result.
